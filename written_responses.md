3) Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
   Cellular Automata are used to model several phenomena present in the real world. Since CA is just a
   mathematical model that have simple rules governing their replication and destruction, it can be used to simulate similar models in the real world.
