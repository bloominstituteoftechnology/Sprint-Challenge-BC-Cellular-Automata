1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

-A new block can be added to the chain if it has hashed a proof or worked that matches the requirements of the chain and has not been used already, usually this criteria includes a certain number of leading zeroes, but can be anything.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

- Users can mine coinds by usinf algorithms that find valid proofs of work, this mean, algorithms that create hashes meeting the criteria of requirements set on the blockchain and has not been used already, if they have a valid proof they get a coin.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

- Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a simple rule-set that models the evolution of systems. Cellular automata can simulate a variety of real-world systems, including biological and chemical ones. The concepts can be used to improve our understanding of complex systems and how to form complex systems out of simple parts.
