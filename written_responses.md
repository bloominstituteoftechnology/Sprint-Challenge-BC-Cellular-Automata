1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.
    not sure where to start so Ill start with transactions. using bitcoin as an example, transactions are created between two users on the bitcoin network to exchange information. a block is composed of transactions that are looking to be confirmed on the network. a block is composed of a reference to a previous block on the chain, transactions and its hash. its hash. this block can confirmed on the chain once people guess the values once this random value is guessed the node that guessed it broadcasts its mathmatical proof. other nodes on the network quickly confirm its authenticity and add this broadcasted block to their chain and once a majority of nodes consider that block as confirmed then its added then I would consider it added to the chain. Also you have to consider the amount of time since the block was confirmed. the greater the time from when the block was confirme the more confidence the block will remain confirmed.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?
    blockchain users can mine coins by participating in the guessing of the current blocks hash. if they can guess the value of the hash they then win and as a reward for guessing they are compensated in the form of a created bitcoin. each block that is confirmed mined and added to the blockchain represents 12.5 bitcoin per block. 
 
3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
    conways game of life can be used to create procedurally generated envrionments within vidoe games. It can also be used to model biological systems for testing and understanding the human body
