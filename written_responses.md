2. How can blockchain users mine coins?
    Blockchain users can mine coins by trying different proofs. If the proof is valid given the set of requirements for a proof and has not already been found, the user gets a coin.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
    An example of real world use of Conway's Game of Life would be to model the population growth. Game logic would be set to match assumptions about rules for population growth. Population growth could be forecasted over multiple generations over a short period of time.
